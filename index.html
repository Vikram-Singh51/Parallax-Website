       <p class="text">Dhodap fort, It has a rich history where the fort belonged to Nizams up to the 16th century. Later it was captured by the Peshwas until the Marathas took over this fort and used it as a jail. The fort later went into the hands of the British when they conquered the Marathas in 1818.Located about 60 km from Nashik, on top of the Dhodap hill in Kalwan and Chandwad districts of Maharashtra, stands the Dhodap Fort - the second highest mountain fort in the Sahyadri Mountain range.</p>

       </div>
       <p class="text">Documented as Dhorapavanki or Dharab during different periods in history, the Dhodap Fort was captured by the Mughal forces in 1635. The Fort had its days of glory under the Peshwa rule, when it was one of the prime forts of Nashik. When Raghunath Rao, a Maratha general, plotted to overthrow and capture the throne of Peshwa Madhav Rao, he camped in this fort. The Peshwa’s forces advanced towards Dhodap, Raghunath Rao was captured and deported to Poona to be confined. In 1818, the Fort was taken over by the British.The steep zigzagging trail leading to the Fort on the hill has made this site a favourite with hikers. The remains of the boundary has a double gate with a series of bastions and walls called the khandari or outworks.

                  <h2 class="thirdheading">LOHAGAD FORT</h2>
                  </div>
                  <p class="text">Information on this fort is quite scant, so I would appreciate any comments regarding additions or changes to the timeline I have compiled. As always, please click on any image to view it in a larger format.

                        Lohagad would normally be considered to be one of the easier forts to hike to. With ample parking at Lohagadwadi, it’s a short but steep 30 minute climb up a series of steps through four defended gateways to the summit which rises to an elevation of 1,033m. Unfortunately for me the approach road to the north of the village was closed for repairs, and so my car had to be parked not very far from Bhaja Caves and the rest of the journey to the base of the fort done on foot. Although not ideal, it did give me a greater appreciation for the scale of these hills/mountains as I wound my way on the road that bisects Lohagad from the neighbouring Visapur Fort.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="text">A local folktale surrounds this specific gateway. It is said that construction of the gate had to cease as the bastion had poor foundations. In a dream, Nana Fadnavis was warned that the fort defences would never be completed until the favour of the god of the hill was won, which would only be achieved by buying alive a man and a woman. After some time, a Maratha of the Sabale clan agreed to offer his eldest son and his son’s wife.

                         A hole was subsequently dug and the two were buried alive, upon which the foundations of the bastion were reconstructed and have stood firm ever since. As a reward for this sacrifice, the head of the village of Lohvadi was given to the Sabale father and removed from a Ghadshi family. Apparently the head of police in the village is a direct descendant of the Sabale father who made this ultimate gesture 230 years ago.</p>
